Jem: Let's go right.

Grant: Oh, I was thinking left.

Jem: Why's that? I just chose randomly.

Grant: Whenever I have to choose between left or right randomly I always choose left. Do you have anything you do like that?

Jem: Not really. Well actuallly I think I usually choose right.

Grant: Didn't feel like changing it up?

Jem: Do you want to just go left? If you're gonna keep complaining about it-

Grant: No no, I trust your judgement.

Jem: Right.

Narrator: We walked in silence for a while. There were some sort of blue crystals that were embedded within the cavern walls that lit the way. It was cold and the air was wet with moisture.

Jem: I used to explore caves with my dad.

Grant: Yah?

Jem: We were poor but really close. One of the ways we got food was by spelunking.

Grant: You found food in caves?

Jem: Apparently some people from the second age built these farms that mostly had potatoes in caves.

Grant: Don't farms need, you know, sun?

Jem: There were these lamps. We couldn't figure out what kept them going but they put this bright light on the crops. There were these machines that watered them too, probably took water from somewhere deeper underground.

Grant: I can't help but wonder why a farm like that would be built hidden away in a cave.

Jem: We never told anyone in the village that we found it. We were afraid they'd destroy it if they did.

Grant: Hm.

Jem: What?

Grant: Well, seems selfish.

Jem: Selfish?

Grant: Yah, I'd guess the people in your village were poor too.

Jem: They were.

Grant: So why would you keep that information to yourself? They have all the same reasons as you did to keep it going.

Jem: In my experience, when our people found ancient technology, they opted to take it apart for research. They'd want to learn from it but end up destroying it in the process.

Grant: That's progress.

Jem: That's what's selfish. We have lives that need to be sustained right now. We can use that technology instead of having to constantly reserve it just for research.

Grant: If we could build our own machines we could-

Jem: I know I know, but I just get tired of hearing that excuse when people are starving.

Grant: Jem.

Jem: I don't really wanna talk about it anymore.

Grant: No, look.

Narrator: Straight ahead of me standing halfway around the corner was the outline of some kind of human. Stray hairs clung to the top of its head and its skin looked like leather. Its mouth seemed to be formed for a constant scream, but the only sound that was coming out was a slight groan. It looked more mutant than human. As it emerged into our path, another followed.

Jem: Uh, hello?

Grant: That's not a person.

Jem: Are you guys ok?

Grant: That's not a person.

Narrator: It was like the first mutant suddenly noticed we were there. It whipped it's head to face me. As it began barreling towards me, so did its companion.

Grant: Get ready!

**Begin fight with Mutant**

Jem: That was close. You ok?

Narrator: I looked down to see Grant on the floor writhing.

Jem: Grant!

Grant: It... my neck...

Narrator: He held his neck and his eyes were bloodshot. He was dying.

Jem: No, no, no, no!

Narrator: I could feel myself beginning to panic.

Jem: I'm going to heal your neck, ok? I'll need you to take your hand off of it in a second.

Grant: No, too... Listen...

Narrator: He was on the brink, I had to act now. I forced his hand away from his neck and focused my staff right on the bite. It was worse than I imagined, but I pushed all worry and fear away as I took a deep breath and channeled my magic. The staff glowed and illuminated his face and the rocky walls surrounding us. His face began fading and he could only mutter one more word.

Grant: Time...

Narrator: A final breath escaped Grant as we sat on the earth floor. I backed up against the wall and sat for a while unable to move. I felt paralyzed. Grant had been my first and best friend since enlisting. For some reason I'd assumed we'd always be fighting alongside one another.

Narrator: It wasn't necessarily a conscious thought but in the back of my mind somewhere I'd always imagined we'd be old and retired and still arguing the meaning of our existence and making lame jokes.

Narrator: For a while I just sat. I don't know for how long, but I couldn't bring myself to move. There was a cold that I felt in the caverns sitting there. It started in my spine and grew to my extremities as I felt a sense of loneliness I hadn't felt ever.

Narrator: I remembered a prayer I memorized in my days in the village. Prayer LVII. Grand Star Igna read the prayer in my head. "Every atom has a role to play. Selflessly, atoms carry out their tasks for the good of the universe. So too shall we. We are devoted servants to humanity, and by extension, the universe."

Narrator: Why? Why was I feeling sorry for myself? Comrades die. This is what I signed up for. I knew this could happen.

Narrator: I had a mission. It was time to carry it out selflessy and play my role in the universe, just as Grant played his. I stood and patted the dirt off my cloak. Not wanting to look at Grant's body, I continued forward.

Jem: "Selflessly, atom carry out their tasks for the good of the universe. So too shall we."

???: That's an interesting thing to say.

Jem: Whoa! What?

???: That's an interesting thing to say to yourself. 

Jem: Oh, yah. What?

Wing: You can call me Wing. I think it's a fitting name because I... clearly have only one wing. It's a fitting and cute name right?

Jem: Sure.

Wing: Your dead friend called you Jem?

Jem: Yes. So you just watched while those things mauled us?

Wing: I did.

Jem: Why didn't you try to help us somehow?

Wing: Help you? By doing what? You think I should have flapped my wing at those monsters' faces? Would that have helped?

Jem: I don't know, maybe. I just lost my best friend and you just sat there and watched two people get attacked by monsters.

Wing: How do you know I'm not a monster?

Jem: Well you definitely look like one. But you can talk and stuff, what do you mean?

Wing: Do you know that they couldn't talk and stuff? They may have been as sentient as us.

Jem: They attacked us, ok? We had to fight for our lives and you did nothing to help a stranger.

Wing: Forgive and move on.

Jem: What?

Wing: It's a saying. The past is the past and there's no sense giving me a hard time for your shortcomings. Forgive and move on.

Jem: Whatever.

Narrator: This sentient bat creature continued to follow me as I walked the continually narrowing path of the labyrinth. I thought of a way to ask why it looked the way it did, and how it came to be in this place.

Wing: Why are you here?

Jem: ...

Narrator: I realized I didn't know the allegiance of this creature. It was probably best if I came up with a believable story. I took a long stretch while I thought of a story so I didn't look like I was searching for an answer.

Jem: I'm with the Scholar Guild. Me and my comrade are researchers that were sent here. For... research.

Wing: I don't understand. Why was it just you and your friend that were sent?

Jem: Large groups have tried to explore the Somnium Labyrinth before and either perished or barely made it out of here alive. The guild was betting that our chances of succeeding in our quest would be much higher if we went in with just a couple of people. For some reason it seems like the larger the group, the more the labyrinth wants to expell the intruders.

Wing: Ah! I hadn't thought of it that way. When you put it like that it makes sense. It was still pretty stupid of you to come here I'd say.

Jem: We came here with a mission. I won't let my people down.

Narrator: Wing came to a halt and crouched behind a rock that was before an opening in the cave.

Wing: Sshh.

Jem: What?

Wing: Look.

Narrator: After crouching with Wing, I looked ahead and saw a woman cleaning her cloak using the water at the base of a waterfall. Her braided blonde hair trailed down her back and where it ended I noticed the crest of Terra marked her uniform. A sheathed sword lay on the ground next to her as she worked.

Narrator: What should I do? This was perhaps my only opportunity to get the jump on this enemy.

**choice: "I have to kill her now!" - "For now, we could work together."**
