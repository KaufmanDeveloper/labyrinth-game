## Summation Notes

---

Jem: Let's go left.

Grant: I was thinking the same actually.

Jem: Why's that? I just chose randomly.

Grant: Whenever I have to choose between left or right randomly I always choose left. Do you have anything you do like that?

Jem: Not really. Well actuallly I think I usually choose right.

Grant: Whoa. Crazy.

Narrator: The metal walls became metal floors as well as we walked, and soon we found ourselves in a familiar kind of setting.

Jem: When I heard stories about Somnium Labyrinth I had heard it was a remnant of the second age. Looks like it was a true.

Grant: Man... Sometimes I wonder wish I was born in the second age. How were they able to build things like this?

Jem: I know they were closer to the Celestials than we are.

Grant: Yah?

Jem: Think about it. If Neptune gave us magic, and the people of the second age created all these magic artifacts, it would make sense that they had much stronger ties to the Celestials as well.

Grant: Mm.

Narrator: We continued walking for a while in silence. Grant wouldn't discuss Astran philosophies with me very much. He would usually just nod in agreement with me and we'd move on. A door opened in front of us.

Grant: An elevator.

Jem: Is that what these were called?

Grant: Yah, it's going to take us lower looks like.

Jem: Deeper into the abyss.

Grant: Man, you make it sound so epic.

Jem: I'm guessing I just press the big button here?

Grant: DON'T PRESS THAT!!!

Jem: ...

Grant: Yah that should take us down.

Narrator: I pressed the button and felt the machine whirr. It shook a bit at first but then glided smoothly deeper into the earth.

Grant: I don't think I've ever asked about your parents.

Jem: My parents? What made you think of that?

Grant: My dad used to show me machines like this from the second age.

Jem: Archivist?

Grant: Yah, he would go on and on about their "genious" and all that. It's interesting stuff but when you have to hear about it all day...

Jem: You guys close?

Grant: Nah. We kinda had a falling out. Less so with my mom but kinda with her too.

Jem: What about?

Grant: It doesn't matter. We just had different opinions and it was driving me crazy to be near them.

Jem: When you told me you joined the army because you wanted a change is that what you meant?

Grant: Yah. I wanted to do something for myself. Before I left home it felt like I was just going through the motions every day in my life and never really experiencing anything. Do you know what I mean?

Jem: I think so. It's hard for me to imagine because I think I always knew what I wanted. I'm really close to my family, and they supported me from day one being in the military.

Grant: Oh yah?

Jem: My mother and father met in the army. They said "Astra for Eternity" in their vows alright, we're tied to this stuff.

Grant: This is a slow elevator.

Jem: It feels like we're slowing down.

Narrator: The elevator stopped and the doors opened.
