- Prologue

* Path 1 - Left
* Path 2 - Right

### General Setting

- It is the third age on Earth. Scholars have determined the first age is all of mankind before the great heat, the second age was when humanity discovered magic and bore great underground structures and ended with some pandemic, and the third age is after the revival and rebuilding of humanity from the primal surviving few that came from the second age
- Astra is trying to take Terra Manus, the capitol of the Terran empire
- Astrans believe in the Stars and Celestials as deity, and have a warped understanding of Astrology as their religion
- The Terrans believe in the deities of Earth, Fire, and Water. Have a warped understanding of Geology as their religion
- "Magic" is used through artifacts which is just technology from the ancient humans that used "Intention" as a driver. (Supposed to use an enhancer chip to use artifacts but humans evolved over time to be able to use them without)

### Somnium Labyrinth

- The other words on the sign to Somnium Labyrinth have whithered off the sign, so all that remains are the words "Somnium"
- Used to be a containment zone containing pods for the elite who chose to be in stasis with their families, but all the pods died off (other than a few)
- The heart of the labyrinth contains different things depending on which ending you get

- The doctors are from the second age
- Ben starts laughing madly when he sees Jem's staff

### Path 1 - 1 (Go to The Laboratory)

- The pandemic spread by using virus fueled technology
- Unsure if attack by someone or not, but humanity didn't know how to handle it and revert to being without technology
- The laboratory was supposed to be where a vaccine would be developed (never succeeded)

- When few humans were found to be immune to the virus, they were supposed to be cloned

### Path 2 (Right - Religion/Family/Understanding)

- You find empty cryo stasis pods and fight husks
- Tara is found, a Terran priest
- Grant takes the lead and convinces Tara they are with the Scholar Guild. They were a brave two that convinced the guild they should be funded to go on an expedition to the Somnium Labyrinth for research.

### Path 2 - 1 (Kill Tara - The labyrinth takes you to the Somnium Chambers)

- Rows and rows of cryo stasis pods that failed
- An AI speaks to you over loudspeaker
- The AI is confused as to what it's supposed to do now, some remain in the stasis pods but the world isn't anything like it was in the second age, and there's still no vaccine
