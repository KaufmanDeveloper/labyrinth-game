Narrator: 23 days. We'd been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Tired and bruised I layed in the lush grass staring at the stars. I could see Venus shining Her brilliant light among the twinkling backdrop. I whispered a short prayer to Her thanking her for the things the army gave me - money, and when I retired, a home. I hadn't heard any commands for hours. It was the perfect time for a short nap...

Grant: Rise and shine Jem.

Jem: ...

Grant: Up and at 'em.

Jem: ...

Grant: WAKE UP!!!

Jem: I heard you the first time. I was hoping if I kept my eyes closed you'd get bored and leave me alone.

Grant: You've got a real go getter attitude, you know that?

Jem: We've been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. With just enough food to get by I've been sneaking off and taking naps whenever I can.

Grant: Want a drink?

Jem: I want a smoke.

Grant: It's kind of pretty.

Jem: What's that?

Grant: Terra Manus under fire. All the fire and smoke kind of frames the city in a new light.

Jem: Oh yah I guess so.

Jem: ...

Jem: Any idea why we haven't had any word from the queen in days? Feels like we should be moving to the final phase of the attack soon.

Grant: That's actually why I was looking for you. Igna's sick.

Jem: Sick how?

Grant: Some kinda fever took her. Hasn't woken up since the failed attack on the gates.

Jem: Sounds rough. You got any tobacco on you?

Grant: The Star Seer said he needs to speak with you. Neptune spoke to him last moon.

Jem: Hah, right.

Grant: I'm serious. You're to report to the queen's tent.

Jem: I don't get it.

Grant: You're a nobody, I know.

Jem: Thanks.

Grant: The Seer said he saw you in a dream.

Narrator: My thoughts were empty as we walked silently to the Star Seer's tent. I checked that my staff was accounted for and tried to quickly wipe away a grass stain on my cloak.

Seer: Grant. This is the one?

Grant: This is Jem.

Seer: The queen is ill, Jem, she hasn't woken in 22 hours. Without her guidance we cannot continue our attack. We cannot wait here for too long either or we will run out of food and resources.

Seer: Neptune has blessed me with a vision. Have you heard of _name here_ Labyrinth?

Jem: I've been told by soldiers it's a cursed underground cavern near here.

Seer: It's more than a cavern. And it contains powerful magic at its heart.

Jem: Yah, they told me about the Lightning Flower.

-- About to enter labyrinth

Jem: Is this stupid?

Grant: Let me light one of these lanterns.

Jem: Are we being stupid?

Grant: Probably.

Jem: We're going to die in this cave.

Grant: It's for a greater cause.

Jem: Would anyone find us if we ditched?

Grant: We're not discussing that.

Jem: Just saying, we could say we're army and just-

Grant: Our deaths are for the stars and the heavens.

Jem: Praise the stars. I'll say nothing more about it...

Grant: Sounds good to me.

Narrator: We entered the cavernous jaw of the labyrinth. I could feel my legs shaking as I took every step. I was ashamed of what I said
