## Part 1

Context Info: The Astran army has been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Queen Igna II has fallen ill and has been unable to direct the army. This has caused the siege to come to a stand still. The Star Seer has summoned Jem with an important message...

- Work in the religious aspects of Astra, lay groundwork

---

Narrator: 23 days. We'd been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Tired and bruised I layed in the lush grass staring at the stars. I could see Venus shining Her brilliant light among the twinkling backdrop. I whispered a short prayer to Her thanking her for the things the army gave me - money, and when I retired, a home. I hadn't heard any commands for hours. It was the perfect time for a short nap...

Grant: Rise and shine Jem.

Jem: ...

Grant: Up and at 'em.

Jem: ...

Grant: WAKE UP!!!

Jem: I heard you the first time. I was hoping if I kept my eyes closed you'd get bored and leave me alone.

Grant: You've got a real go getter attitude, you know that?

Jem: We've been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. With just enough food to get by I've been sneaking off and taking naps whenever I can.

Grant: Want a drink?

Jem: I want a smoke.

Grant: It's kind of pretty.

Jem: What's that?

Grant: Terra Manus under fire. All the fire and smoke kind of frames the city in a new light.

Jem: Oh yah I guess so.

Jem: ...

Jem: Any idea why we haven't had any word from the queen in days? Feels like we should be moving to the final phase of the attack soon.

Grant: That's actually why I was looking for you. Igna's sick.

Jem: Sick how?

Grant: Some kinda fever took her. Hasn't woken up since the failed attack on the gates.

Jem: Sounds rough. You got any tobacco on you?

Grant: The Star Seer said he needs to speak with you. Neptune spoke to him last moon.

Jem: Hah, right.

Grant: I'm serious. You're to report to the queen's tent.

Jem: I don't get it.

Grant: You're a nobody, I know.

Jem: Thanks.

Grant: The Seer said he saw you in a dream.

Narrator: My thoughts were empty as we walked silently to the Star Seer's tent. I checked that my staff was accounted for and tried to quickly wipe away a grass stain on my cloak.

Seer: Grant. This is the one?

Grant: This is Jem.

Seer: The queen is ill, Jem, she hasn't woken in 22 hours. Without her guidance we cannot continue our attack. We cannot wait here for too long either or we will run out of food and resources.

Seer: Neptune has blessed me with a vision. Have you heard of _name here_ Labyrinth?

Jem: I've been told by soldiers it's a cursed underground cavern near here.

Seer: It's more than a cavern. And it contains powerful magic at its heart.

Jem: Yah, they told me about the Lightning Flower. It holds enough magic to bring the dead back to life. The story says that at least.

Seer: A holding stone can hold enough magic from the flower to bring our Queen back. Take this.

Jem: What?

Seer: You and Grant will gather magic from the Lightning Flower to save our Queen. We can hold this position for two weeks.

Jem: How the-

Grant: Seer Dilan, if you don't mind me asking, why is it you would send the two of us? Explorers and armies have been trying to explore the labyrinth for years and they never return.

Seer: Jupiter has blessed you two. When Neptune spoke to me, I could see the two of you making it out unscathed.

Seer: You are our redemption. Armies haven't made it out of the labyrinth, but you two are blessed by Jupiter and the Stars.

Narrator: There was a pause. I couldn't wrap my head around what the Seer was saying. Grant looked like he was trying to find words. After a pause, he held his hand to the sky.

Grant: Praise the Stars.

Seer: They have blessed us. Go now. The queen and all of Astra is depending on you. Your healing magic will be essential Jem. Concentrate and you will succeed.

Jem: Praise the Stars.

Narrator: My chest felt heavy. The Labyrinth was a myth, something that didn't feel tangible. The magic Jem used was simple and known to many. The magic that Labyrinth contained was the kind of powerful magic that was lost with time. It was the magic of the Old Kingdoms.

Jem: Is this stupid?

Grant: Let me light one of these lanterns.

Jem: Are we being stupid?

Grant: Probably.

Jem: We're going to die in this cave.

Grant: It's for a greater cause.

Jem: Would anyone find us if we ditched?

Grant: We're not discussing that.

Jem: Just saying, we could say we're army and just-

Grant: Our deaths are for the stars and the heavens.

Jem: Praise the Stars. I'll say nothing more about it...

Grant: Sounds good to me.

Narrator: We entered the cavernous jaw of the labyrinth. I could feel my legs shaking as I took every step. I was ashamed of what I said. Mars blessed us with ambition and courage, and I faltered.

Narrator: The walls were covered with dirt but within I could see some sort of brick. Grant lit the lantern and the insects created the illusion that the walls and ceiling were moving.

Grant: Oh, nice.

Jem: I think I'm good to die now. That's disgusting.

Grant: What is THAT?
