## Part 1

Context Info: The Astran army has been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Queen Igna II has fallen ill and has been unable to direct the army. This has caused the siege to come to a stand still. The Star Seer has summoned Jem with an important message...

Narrator: 23 days. We'd been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Tired and bruised I layed in the lush grass staring at the stars. I hadn't heard any commands for hours. It was the perfect time for a short nap, away from the eyes of the colonel...

Peeter: Rise and shine Jem.

Jem: ...

Peeter: Up and at 'em.

Jem: ...

Peeter: WAKE UP!!!

Jem: I heard you the first time. I was hoping if I kept my eyes closed you'd get bored and leave me alone.

Peeter: You've got a real go getter attitude, you know that?

Jem: We've been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. With just enough food to get by I've been sneaking off and taking naps whenever I can.

Peeter: The Star Seer said he needs to speak with you. Neptune spoke to him last moon.

Jem: Hah, right.

Peeter: I'm serious. You're to report to the queen's tent.

Jem: I met him for the first time the other day when I

-- About to enter labyrinth

Jem: Is this stupid?

Peeter: Let me light one of these lanterns.

Jem: Are we being stupid?

Peeter: Probably.

Jem: We're going to die in this cave.

Peeter: It's for a greater cause.

Jem: Would anyone find us if we ditched?

Peeter: We're not discussing that.

Jem: Just saying, we could say we're army and just-

Peeter: Our deaths are for the stars and the heavens.

Jem: Praise the stars. I'll say nothing more about it...

Peeter: Sounds good to me.

Narrator: We entered the cavernous jaw of the labyrinth. I could feel my legs shaking as I took every step. I was ashamed of what I said
