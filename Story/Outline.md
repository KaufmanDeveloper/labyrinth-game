### Gameplay

- Mostly visual novel
- Turn taking action based battle system with mini games
- Mini games (puzzles?) also to progress through story

### General Setting

- It is the third age on Earth. Scholars have determined the first age is all of mankind before the great heat, the second age was when humanity discovered magic and bore great underground structures and ended with some pandemic, and the third age is after the revival and rebuilding of humanity from the primal surviving few that came from the second age
- Astra is trying to take Terra Manus, the capitol of the Terran empire
- "Praise the Heavens" is common Astran phrase.
- Astrans believe in the Stars and Celestials as deity, and have a warped understanding of Astrology as their religion
- The Terrans believe in the deities of Earth, Fire, and Water. Have a warped understanding of Geology as their religion
- "Magic" is used through artifacts which is just technology from the ancient humans that used "Intention" as a driver. (Supposed to use an enhancer chip to use artifacts but humans evolved over time to be able to use them without)
- You are Jem, a skilled healer with a Regeneration Staff. You are much more however as you have the ability to interface with ancient technology better than any other. You find this out through the different story paths.
- After going through all story paths, you wake in the morning after the assault on Terra Manus and have knowledge of going through all of them.
- A pandemic is taking place, and Queen Igna gets sick with it, assumed to die before recovery

### Somnium Labyrinth

- The other words on the sign to Somnium Labyrinth have whithered off the sign, so all that remains are the words "Somnium"
- Used to be a containment zone containing pods for the elite who chose to be in stasis with their families, but all the pods died off (other than a few)
- The heart of the labyrinth contains different things depending on which ending you get
