## Part 1

Tori Feedback:

- Beginning is interesting

- Why are planet names being used? May need more information. Start sooner?

- Felt like it moved really fast.

- How does queen fit into any of this?

_Start with an attack of some kind, after successful attack, Queen Igna gives a service_

Context Info: The Astran army has been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. Queen Igna has fallen ill and has been unable to direct the army. This has caused the siege to come to a stand still. The Star Seer has summoned Jem with an important message...

- Work in the religious aspects of Astra, lay groundwork

- Show Grant being naive, show Jem being religious

---

Narrator: We had arrived at Terra Manus a week ago. It stood as the center of the Terran Empire. Grand Star Igna took Kelan's place only weeks ago. She was ambitious and it was said she had been wanting to take Terra Manus since she was a child waiting for the throne. If the Terran Empire was ever to be conquered, its capitol was key. It stood between Astra and Terra on a narrow piece of connecting land. The Terrans believe the earth blesses their city and all who worship it. They believe in the goddess of earth, the goddess of fire, and the goddess of water. They believe their bond blesses all who believe in them, and that their belief has given them a holy empire.

Narrator: I know this to be a false belief. The Astran people understand that the Gods come from the skies. Earth is merely the ground that we stand on. The Celestials govern the universe. Mars gave me power when I stood gazing at the Terra Manus gates with hate in my eyes and war in my heart. Saturn gave me the understanding to follow my commands and stay calm as we approached the gates of the enemy. This was my first campaign. I was eager to prove myself and impatiently grasped my staff as I stared at the great wall.

Grant: A full frontal assault already.

Jem: I'm ready.

Grant: ...

Grand Star Igna: Take your ranks!

Narrator: My heart was pounding with excitement.

Grand Star Igna: Forward!

Narrator: As we moved toward the Terra Manus gates I made sure to stay behind Grant. Healers' top priority was the soldier in front of them as well as the soldier to that soldier's immediate left and right. Though many soldiers wanted to be healers, not all were gifted with the ability to commune with the magic of the Stars. Artifacts like the staff I was given were also rare enough to be preserved only for those most talented. Soldiers outnumbers healers about 20 to 1, so we were spread out behind waves in order to be the most effective.

Jem: You ready to kill some Terrans?

Grant: ...

Grant: I think I'm gonna be sick.

Jem: You're fighting for the glory of Astra.

Grant: Yup, gonna be sick...

Narrator: The party that awaited us were clad in iron armor and stood still as we approached. Sol stood behind us and cast an orange light on the great walls of Terra Manus.

Grant: Arrows!

Jem: The arrows are aimed for behind us, where most of our troops are. Don't stop moving forward.

Narrator: Grant resisted the urge to raise his shield above his head and run. My focus was on looking for if any stray arrows hit anyone near me. The first wave our line made it through unscathed minus a few troops already being tended to.

Grant: They're charging us!

Jem: Alright here we go. Take a lower crouching stance.

Grant: Hoo, ok.

Narrator: The Terran soldiers shouted battle cries as they clashed against our line. Their words were white noise as I prepared my magic. The power of Mars flowed through my veins and I couldn't stop shaking from excitement. After an almost slowed down moment before the armies connected, contact was made.

Narrator: I wasn't prepared for just how fast they would cut through our troops. Our front line was torn apart in moments. There was no hope of saving most of ours that met the sword of the defending army.

Jem: Grant! Left!

Narrator: Grant's head whipped to his left as he met the attacker that cut down the man to his left. As he began brawling him, a man approached from in front of Grant. I rushed forward to prevent him from backstabbing my best friend.

_Initiate battle with soldier_

Narrator: I looked to Grant to see if he was ok. A gash ran the length of his arm and I immediately began healing it. As I did so the second volley of arrows flew overhead to strike behind us yet again. For a brief moment I looked around to see our numbers getting thinned. We were vastly outmatched.

Grand Star Igna: Retreeeaaaaat! By Mercury, fall back!

Jem: What?

Grant: You heard her, let's get going!

Narrator: Right after we began the assault we got the signal to retreat. Grand Star Igna's plate mail helm clashed against her breastplate. The star symbol on her wooden shield had blood spattered on it as she used it to block an attacker's sword strike.

Jem: Two more! Grant!

Grant: I got this one.

_Initiate battle with soldier_

Jem: You good?

Grant: Yah, let's go!

Narrator: We scrambled to retreat behind our back line as well timed cannon shots fired into the ranks of the Terrans. Our supply of cannonballs were limited, so I knew it was costly for us to be forced to use them to cover a failed attack. The hours that ensued afterwards were spent healing the wounded. A few of the soldiers I was healing died while I was tending to their wounds. It was draining work. I couldn't help but think about what it would have been like to stand within the walls of the Terran capitol. This was the 23rd day of the assault, and this was the first time I had the chance to be among the front lines of an assault on the gates. I understood now why every frontal assault had failed. Grand Star Igna approached and I stood and saluted.

Grand Star Igna: I want everyone to know I understand the sacrifice you all made when you retreated. Mars was with us today, but the Terrans are strong. I will continue to ask Mercury for guidance.

Narrator: Her voice was strong and commanding, but I noticed her face was pale and sweat stuck her bangs to her forehead.

Grand Star Igna: We will take Terra Manus. I have seen our victory in a dream the Stars blessed me with.

Narrator: Our queen looked excited as she said the words. The defeat seemed to falter her spirit none.

Grand Star Igna: Service is in one hour. Praise the heavens.

Narrator: We held one hand to the sky and repeated: "Praise the heavens." She turned and walked away.

Narrator: I looked at Grant. His eyes were bloodshot and he was still breathing heavy. He looked back at the gates of Terra Manus and my gaze followed. They would be celebrating in that city over the death of my comrades. We couldn't recover all the bodies from the battlefield. I bowed my head and said a short prayer for their souls. Those that we could manage to retrieve were being carried off on wooden gurneys for ascension.

Narrator: Few words were exchanged as we made our way back to camp and waited for Service.

-- After battle and service

Narrator: Tired and bruised I laid in the lush grass staring at the stars. I could see Venus shining Her brilliant light among the twinkling backdrop. I whispered a short prayer to Her thanking her for the things the army gave me - money, and when I retired, a home. I hadn't heard any commands for hours. It was the perfect time for a short nap...

Grant: Rise and shine Jem.

Jem: ...

Grant: Up and at 'em.

Jem: ...

Grant: WAKE UP!!!

Jem: I heard you the first time. I was hoping if I kept my eyes closed you'd get bored and leave me alone.

Grant: You've got a real go getter attitude, you know that?

Jem: We've been laying siege to Terra Manus for 23 days. With just enough food to get by I've been sneaking off and taking naps whenever I can.

Grant: Want a drink?

Jem: I want a smoke.

Grant: It's kind of pretty.

Jem: What's that?

Grant: Terra Manus under fire. All the fire and smoke kind of frames the city in a new light.

Jem: Oh yah I guess so.

Jem: ...

Jem: Any idea why we haven't had any word from the queen in days? Feels like we should be moving to the final phase of the attack soon.

Grant: That's actually why I was looking for you. Igna's sick.

Jem: Sick how?

Grant: Some kinda fever took her. Hasn't woken up since the failed attack on the gates.

Jem: Sounds rough. You got any tobacco on you?

Grant: The Star Seer said he needs to speak with you. Neptune apparently spoke to him last moon.

Jem: Hah, right.

Grant: I'm serious. He told me to get you.

Jem: I don't get it.

Grant: You're a nobody, I know. Must be surprising the Star Seer would want to summon a nobody.

Jem: Thanks.

Grant: He said he saw you in a dream.

Jem: Bless Neptune. Let's not waste any time.

Narrator: My thoughts were empty as we walked silently to the Star Seer's tent. I checked that my staff was accounted for and tried to quickly wipe away a grass stain on my cloak.

Seer: Grant. This is the one?

Narrator: Grant looked nervous.

Grant: This is Jem.

Seer: The queen is ill, Jem, she hasn't woken in 22 hours. Without her guidance we cannot continue our attack. We cannot wait here for too long either or we will run out of food and resources.

Seer: Neptune has blessed me with a vision. Have you heard of _name here_ Labyrinth?

Jem: I've been told by soldiers it's a cursed underground cavern near here.

Seer: It's more than a cavern. And it contains powerful magic at its heart.

Jem: Yah, they told me about the Lightning Flower. It holds enough magic to bring the dead back to life. The story says that at least.

Seer: A holding stone can hold enough magic from the flower to bring our Queen back. Take this.

Jem: What?

Seer: You and Grant will gather magic from the Lightning Flower to save our Queen. We can hold this position for two weeks.

Grant: How the-

Jem: Seer Dilan, if you don't mind me asking, why is it you would send the two of us? Explorers and armies have been trying to explore the labyrinth for years and they never return.

Seer: Jupiter has blessed you two. When Neptune spoke to me, I could see the two of you making it out unscathed.

Seer: You are our redemption. Armies haven't made it out of the labyrinth, but you two are blessed by Jupiter and the Stars.

Narrator: There was a pause. I couldn't wrap my head around what the Seer was saying. I tried to find words. After a pause, I said the only thing I knew to say.

Jem: Praise the Stars.

Seer: They have blessed us. Go now. The queen and all of Astra is depending on you. Your healing magic will be essential Jem. Concentrate and you will succeed.

Narrator: My chest felt heavy. The Labyrinth was a myth, something that didn't feel tangible. The magic Jem used was simple and known to many. The magic that Labyrinth contained was the kind of powerful magic that was lost with time. It was the magic of the Old Kingdoms.

Grant: This is stupid.

Jem: Let me light one of these lanterns.

Grant: Are we being stupid?

Jem: Probably.

Grant: We're going to die in this cave.

Jem: It's for a greater cause.

Grant: Would anyone find us if we ditched?

Jem: We're not discussing that.

Grant: Just saying, we could say we're army and just-

Jem: Our deaths are for the stars and the heavens.

Grant: Praise the Stars. I'll say nothing more about it...

Jem: Sounds good to me.

Narrator: We entered the cavernous jaw of the labyrinth. I could feel my legs shaking as I took every step. I was ashamed of what I said. Mars blessed us with ambition and courage, and I faltered.

Narrator: The walls were covered with dirt but within I could see some sort of brick. Grant lit the lantern and the insects created the illusion that the walls and ceiling were moving.

Jem: Oh, nice.

Grant: I think I'm good to die now. That's disgusting.

Grant: What is THAT?

_Initiate battle with centipede_

Grant: I can't unsee that.

Jem: You know, other than the fact that it was trying to kill us, it was kinda cute.

Grant: You think giant centipedes are cute?

Jem: They're pincers move like they're trying to give you a hug or something.

Grant: ...

Jem: Your legs are still shaking.

Grant: I'm really scared I'm gonna die in this cave.

Jem: I was meaning to ask you about that. I've known you since we joined the Astran Army right?

Grant: Yah. Basic training was fun times.

Jem: You've always been so scared of dying. Like, since you joined.

Grant: What's your point?

Jem: Pluto blesses us with release from the Earth. When you joined the army you should've been ready to die. You're fighting our enemies to the death.

Grant: What do you fight for?

Jem: What do you mean?

Grant: I mean why did you join the army?

Jem: I wanted to embrace Mars and vanquish the people that oppose Astra.

Grant: And why else?

Jem: There is no why else.

Grant: I joined the army for one reason, Jem. I needed money. The army pays well and even allows you to retire pretty early if you survive.

Jem: Yes, Venus gives us a lot. I actually prayed to her yesterday even.

Grant: Yah, so it's not so much about glory and all that. I just wanted to eat.

Jem: Still, when are you going to make peace with yourself? I live every day knowing that I could die.

Grant: Good for you.

Jem: I get the feeling you don't wanna talk about this anymore.

Grant: It looks like we're coming up to a fork. Do you want to go left or right?

Narrator: I thought it was important to get Grant's head straight. A soldier who's afraid to die doesn't fight with the same focus as someone who's made peace with themself. I wasn't sure which way to go. I guess either decision was as good as the other.

_Choose left or right_
