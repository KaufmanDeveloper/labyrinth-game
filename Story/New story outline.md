## Plot

-----

- Can't find sister, mother says she stepped outside for some fresh air
- When you go outside, you meet the Nowhere Man. He is like "cheshire cat" type character, creepy eyes, smile, silhouette. He says he took her to the nowhere place. He takes Jem there as well.

#### Nowhere Place

- Consists of liminal spaces and strange beings
- The secret in the end is that Nowhere Place is a real place that exists between our dimension and other dimensions. Its a kind of "purgatory" where our desires, fears, and memories exist
- The "Nowhere Man" is the God of the Nowhere Place
- (**Why does he take Jem to the Nowhere Place** <-- TBD)

#### Themes (Why are we using liminal spaces?)

- In my youth I felt "empty" a lot of the time. Dissasociation. This is an allegory for that.
- Dealing with rejection and focusing on myself caused me to stop caring
- The people in Nowhere Place are reflections of people in real life that are trapped because they won't be vulnerable and deal with emotions, or let themselves fail. These are all pieces of myself.
- Anger,
